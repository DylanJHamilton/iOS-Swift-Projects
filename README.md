# iOS-Swift-Projects
This repository are some of my works of apps I have created using the Swift Programming Language for iOS Applications.

Have any pointers or anything I could improve on, please send me a message! I love constructive criticism on the logic in my code. This will be the only repo that I will have setup for iOS as Swift has taken over iOS Development! I will be writing more apps in the years to come that will be in this repository, hope my code helps people!
