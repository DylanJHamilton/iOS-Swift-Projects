#iOS Programming III 
Complete Build of a Music Listing App using Master / Detail 
Instead of listing cars, my client wants a few business owners to list their top 10 favorite songs and send screenshots of the results. 
With the results, he is going to pick out random songs at an event and shoutout to the business owner's song. 
The rule was a guilty pleasure, they had to pick embarrassing songs. Thought it would be a nice and quick build for my final iOS Class. ^__^
